# Robust and Practical Solution of Laplacian Equations by Approximate Elimination: Experimental Evaluation

Our paper [Robust and Practical Solution of Laplacian Equations by Approximate Elimination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00709) introduces a new Laplacian linear equation solver, ApproxChol, which is part of the [Laplacians.jl](https://github.com/danspielman/Laplacians.jl/) package.

The paper contains a suite of experiments comparing our solver to several other SDDM linear equation solvers.
Our experiments and results are described in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00709).

This repository provides the test suite code we used to run our experiments. The accompanying website is intended to help readers understand and reproduce our experiments on SDDM linear equation solvers.
